# dl_project
Developping environment:
I used linux and python for my project

Dataset: 
I used the Mnist dataset. It should be imported when the file is run.

Dependencies:
-matplotlib
-numpy
-tensorflow

Description:
My project is a handwriting recognition algorithm based on the mnist dataset. I am not very happy with what I have done. I would have liked to do more than what is explained in beginner's tutorials but unfortunately I ran out of time. The application trains on the data and evaluates the model but I would have liked to be able to implement a program which takes an image of a handwritten number as input and outputs the number. Hopefully I will have improved it by the time of the presentation.
